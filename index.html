  		<p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2rem;">I am a direct product of globalization: being born to a Malaysian mother an American father in Colorado. However, I spent most of my childhood growing up in Malaysia. Having gone to three high schools in three different countries, I have been exposed to many challenges and benefits facing cultural diversity. In college I participated in the Navy ROTC program in hopes of becoming a Marine Officer. Unfortunately, that plan did not happen (a story too long for this forum) and I enlisted to the Marine Corps at the age of 25. I have a beautiful family that has followed me and endured the military lifestyle; being away from home, sometimes over a year. I cannot be more thankful for my wife and daughter who always have their ear on the ground listening and guiding me when life gets a little crazy.</p>

  		<p style="text-align: center; line-height: 2rem;">Being part of the Marine Corps for the better part of 12 years has been nothing but an exciting rollercoaster ride. Leaving my previous job at 25 years old and barely ever working on anything mechanical to being a successful helicopter mechanic and accomplished aviator, it most certainly has been nothing short of a lifetime learning experience. However, it is time for me to hang up the uniform and put on a suit and tie (or maybe t-shirt and shorts) for the next chapter of my life: diving headfirst into the tech industry.</br></br>Technology has always been a large part of my life; from playing my first video game "Wings" on my father's Amiga to coding my first text based game with BASIC in middle school. Passion and enthusiasm has never been on short supply. But to join the ranks of programmers always seemed like a daunting and out of reach task for me. I viewed anything with the title “developer” or “engineer” reserved for the “smart ones”, and that I was not one of them.</br></br>But the realization finally hit me as I reflected on my military accomplishments “I want to do this and I CAN do this!” So, I began my new journey of learning, self-taught at first then enrolling into a Computer Science Program. I am now in a critical stage of my learning, being selected into Microsoft’s Software and Systems Academy, I have been showered by a torrential downpour of knowledge from instructors, mentors and students alike. I have been truly blessed for this rare opportunity and cannot be happier being surrounded by smart, passionate and genuine people.</p>
