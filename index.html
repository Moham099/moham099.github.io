  		<h3 style="text-align:center;">NEVER FEAR OF WHAT YOU MAY ACHIEVE</h3>
  		<p style="text-align: center;">Being part of the Marine Corps for the better part of 12 years has been nothing but an exciting rollercoaster ride. From barely ever working on anything mechanical to being a full fledged helicopter mechanic and aviator, it most certainly has been a welcoming learning experience. However, it is time for me to hang up the uniform and put on a suit and tie (or maybe tshirt and shorts) for the next chapter of my life.</br></br>I have always been passionate about technology my entire life; from playing my first video game "Wings" on my father's Amiga to coding my first text based game with BASIC in middle school. Passion and enthusiasm has neer been on short supply. However, it always seemed so daunting and that any jobs with the title "Engineer" in it is reserved for the smartest people, and I was not one of them.</br></br>But the realization finally hit me that THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO, so time to buckle up and start learning, so here I am learning. Being part of Microsoft's Software and Systems Academy has been a truly humbling and rewarding experience. With many sleepless nights (pun intended; as the course is taught in Eastern Standard Time and I am in Japan Standard Time) it will all be worth it at the end: my knowledge when it comes to Sfotware Development has progressed so far by the aid of my instructor and fellow coursemates.
